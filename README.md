# MTCA - MTC for Android

An Android app for [Mtc](https://github.com/Windore/mtc) with the same syncing capabilities. This
app is mainly for my own personal use and therefore it will probably be only distributed as source
code so installing it will be rather cumbersome.

Note that this app doesn't allow for overwriting and thus you must use the cli app first for writing
to the server.
